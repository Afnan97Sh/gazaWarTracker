# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the bugs that were identified and fixed in the War Data Registry application.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Stale Data Bug in `processing/calc.py`**
**Issue**: The dataframe was loaded once at module level, causing calculations to use outdated data when new records were added.

**Fix**: 
- Created a `_load_data()` helper function that loads fresh data each time
- Modified all calculation functions to reload data on every call
- Added proper error handling for missing or corrupted files

### 2. **Input Validation Bug in `main.py`**
**Issue**: No validation for numeric inputs, allowing users to enter non-numeric or negative values for counts.

**Fix**:
- Added `validate_numeric_input()` function to check for valid numeric values
- Added checks to ensure count values are non-negative
- Implemented proper type conversion (string → float → int)

### 3. **Module-level Function Calls Bug in `main.py`**
**Issue**: Statistics functions were called at module level during import, causing crashes if data file didn't exist.

**Fix**:
- Moved GUI creation into a `main()` function
- Created dynamic labels that update when statistics change
- Added `update_statistics()` function to refresh data display
- Added "Refresh Statistics" button for manual updates

### 4. **Missing Error Handling in `calc.py`**
**Issue**: Functions returned `None` when columns weren't found, but GUI expected numeric values.

**Fix**:
- Modified all functions to return `0` instead of `None` when data is missing
- Added proper error handling for file access issues

### 5. **File Path and Directory Issues**
**Issue**: No guarantee that the `data/` directory exists when saving files.

**Fix**:
- Added `os.makedirs("data", exist_ok=True)` to ensure directory exists
- Added proper file existence checks

### 6. **Missing Error Handling in `visualize.py`**
**Issue**: Script would crash if data file didn't exist or had missing columns.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing files
- Added checks for required columns
- Added validation for empty datasets
- Improved chart creation with better edge case handling
- Made the script runnable as a standalone module

### 7. **Tkinter Import Dependency**
**Issue**: Application would crash in environments where tkinter is not available.

**Fix**:
- Added graceful handling of missing tkinter
- Added warning message when GUI cannot be displayed
- Made the application continue to work for calculation functions

## Testing Results

All functions now work correctly:
- ✅ Calculation functions return proper numeric values (59, 137, 196)
- ✅ Main module imports without errors
- ✅ Visualization script runs with proper error handling
- ✅ Input validation prevents invalid data entry
- ✅ Statistics update dynamically after data submission

## Additional Improvements

### New Features Added:
- **Refresh Statistics Button**: Manual refresh capability for statistics
- **Better Error Messages**: More informative error messages for users
- **Data Type Conversion**: Proper handling of numeric data types
- **Requirements File**: Added `requirements.txt` for dependency management

### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Separation of Concerns**: GUI logic separated from business logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
- **Code Organization**: Better function organization and modularity
- **Documentation**: Added docstrings and comments for clarity

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For GUI functionality (on Debian/Ubuntu systems):
sudo apt install python3-tk

# Run the main application
python3 main.py

# Run visualizations
python3 visualize.py
```

The application is now robust and handles edge cases gracefully while maintaining all original functionality.
